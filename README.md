#Black Jack Game

#Description

This application is a Black Jack simulator. The user is given two options. The user is asked if they would like to play the Black Jack game or if they would like to log off. If the user chooses to play, the game will deal the first round of cards. The cards will then be set up for the player and the dealer.The dealer is programmed to "hit" until the dealer reaches a value of 17 or higher. During the duration of the game one of the dealer's cards will remain hidden. If the player chooses to "stay", reaches the value of 21, or exceeds the value of 21 only then will the hidden card reveal itself. Once the card is revealed the user can see the dealers hand along with the winning results.  

#Technologies Used

Java, Git, Eclipse, I/O, Interface, Abstract Class.

#Lessons Learned

This project is an object oriented program. Building this Black Jack simulator gave me the opportunity to use abstraction. My goal was to make the application as efficient as possible. I was able to encapsulate information in this application by making information private. The functions of inheritance and polymorphism allowed my entities to run smoothly while extending and implementing methods in separate classes.
